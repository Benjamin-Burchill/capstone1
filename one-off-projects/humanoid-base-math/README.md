# 🔬 Mathematical Humanoid Base Generator

**Status:** Research/Educational Subproject  
**Goal:** Explore procedural humanoid generation from mathematical first principles  
**Reality Check:** This is "reinventing the wheel" - useful for learning, not production

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This subproject explores building humanoid base meshes using pure mathematical approaches (splines, lofts, parametric equations) rather than using existing libraries like MakeHuman. 

**Why separate from main project?**
- Educational value: Understanding the complexity of humanoid topology
- Experimentation: Test different mathematical approaches
- Modularity: Can potentially feed into main app OR demonstrate why existing tools are better

**Expected Output:**
- ✅ Low-poly (~500-2k verts) parametric biped meshes
- ✅ Clean quad topology suitable for rigging
- ✅ Adjustable proportions via parameters
- ❌ NOT photorealistic (will look geometric/stylized)
- ❌ NOT competitive with MakeHuman/Blender bases (use those for production)

## 📊 Realism Expectations

| Milestone | Vertex Count | Quality Level | Achievable Timeframe |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Phase 1: Geometric Mannequin** | 200-500 | Stick figure with volumes | 2-3 days |
| **Phase 2: Stylized Humanoid** | 1k-2k | Clean topology, cartoon-like | 1 week |
| **Phase 3: Semi-Realistic** | 5k-10k | Smooth curves, basic anatomy | 2-3 weeks |
| **Phase 4: Realistic** | 20k+ | Requires sculpting/ML hybrid | Months (not pure math) |

**Current Target:** Phase 2 (Stylized Humanoid suitable for low-poly games)

## 🛠️ Technical Approach

### Core Math Techniques
1. **B-Spline Lofting**: Create body sections by sweeping 2D profiles along curves
2. **Parametric Surfaces**: Head/hands as UV spheres/ellipsoids
3. **Anatomical Constraints**: Proportions based on Vitruvian ratios
4. **Symmetry**: Mirror left/right halves for perfect bilateral symmetry
5. **Quad Topology**: Edge loops at joints for deformation

### What This Won't Do
- ❌ Generate realistic faces (requires thousands of control points)
- ❌ Add fine details like fingers/toes (too complex for pure math)
- ❌ Handle extreme fantasy morphs (murloc requires different topology)
- ❌ Compete with artist-sculpted bases

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
cd one-off-projects/humanoid-base-math
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Generate Your First Mesh
```bash
python examples/generate_human.py
```

This creates `outputs/base_human.obj` - view it in Blender/MeshLab.

### Adjust Parameters
Edit `examples/generate_human.py`:
```python
params = HumanoidParams(
    height=1.8,           # Meters
    stockiness=1.2,       # 1.0 = normal, 1.5 = very stocky
    arm_length_ratio=0.4, # Relative to height
    leg_length_ratio=0.5
)
```

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

By working through this subproject, you'll understand:

1. **Why existing tools exist**: The complexity of organic topology
2. **Topology fundamentals**: Edge loops, quads, deformation-friendly structure
3. **Parametric modeling**: How parameters drive geometry
4. **Math vs. Art**: Where equations fail and artist input is needed
5. **Integration points**: How to feed procedural meshes into larger systems

## 🔗 Integration with Main Project

### As a Module (if successful)
```python
# In main character generator
from humanoid_base_math.src.mesh import generate_base_mesh
from humanoid_base_math.src.params import HumanoidParams

base = generate_base_mesh(HumanoidParams(height=1.8))
# Apply morphs on top via main system
```

### As Reference (more likely)
- Use topology patterns learned here
- Port parameter system to Blender shape keys
- Understand limitations of pure procedural approach

## 📚 References & Inspiration

- **SMPL Model**: Statistical body shape model (research paper approach)
- **MakeHuman**: Open-source example of production-quality system
- **Blender Geometry Nodes**: Modern procedural approach
- **Vitruvian Man**: Classical human proportion ratios

## ⚠️ Important Notes

**This is NOT the recommended approach for production!** For your MMORPG character creator, you should:
- Use MakeHuman/MPFB as base mesh
- Build morphing system on top (your current approach)
- Reserve pure math for specific features (horns, tails)

**This subproject exists to:**
- Explore "what if we built from scratch"
- Learn why existing tools are valuable
- Potentially contribute topology/parameter insights to main project

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**Minimal Success:**
- Generate watertight biped mesh with head/torso/4 limbs
- Parameters control height, proportions, stockiness
- Exportable to OBJ with clean quad topology

**Good Success:**
- Smooth subdivision-ready topology
- Edge loops at all joints
- Multiple body type presets (human, dwarf, etc.)
- Sub-1-second generation time

**Exceptional Success:**
- Semi-realistic appearance (cartoon quality)
- Procedural detail features (simple ears, fingers)
- Integration into main project's pipeline

## 🗺️ Development Roadmap

- [ ] **Day 1-2**: Basic geometric mannequin (cylinders + spheres)

## 📞 When to Ask for Help

- Math issues (spline interpolation, vertex calculations)
- Topology problems (non-manifold geometry, holes)
- Export/visualization issues
- Integration questions

**Remember:** This is a learning exercise. If you need production-quality humanoids quickly, use MakeHuman. If you want to understand the problem deeply, keep building! 🚀
