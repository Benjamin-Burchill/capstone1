## System Overview

This Unity RPG system demonstrates **professional game architecture** using the same patterns found in games like Skyrim, World of Warcraft, and other AAA RPGs.

### Key Features
- âœ… **Unified Character System** - Player and NPCs share 90% of code
- âœ… **Modular Input Sources** - Easy to switch between player input and AI
- âœ… **Data-Driven Design** - Stats stored in ScriptableObjects
- âœ… **Component-Based** - Mix and match behaviors
- âœ… **Professional Patterns** - Industry-standard architecture

### Current Implementation
- **Player Character** with WASD movement and click-to-attack combat
- **Goblin NPCs** with pack AI and chasing behavior
- **Mammoth NPCs** with peaceful-until-provoked behavior
- **Health System** with 3D text displays
- **XP/Leveling System** with stat progression
- **Combat System** with damage, cooldowns, and visual feedback

## Architecture Philosophy

### The Core Insight: Input is the Only Difference

In professional RPGs, the **ONLY** difference between a player character and an NPC is **where their input comes from**:

```csharp
// Player = Character + Human Input
Player: UniversalCharacter + PlayerInputSource

// Goblin = Character + AI Input  
Goblin: UniversalCharacter + GoblinAI_InputSource

// Mammoth = Character + Different AI Input
Mammoth: UniversalCharacter + MammothAI_InputSource
```

Everything else (movement, combat, health, inventory) uses **identical code**.

### Benefits of This Approach
1. **Code Reuse**: Write movement once, works for everyone
2. **Consistency**: All characters behave predictably
3. **Easy Testing**: Can make player AI-controlled or NPC player-controlled
4. **Multiplayer Ready**: Just swap input sources
5. **Easy Balancing**: Change stats in data files, not code

---

## Core Components

### 1. UniversalCharacter.cs
**The foundation class used by ALL characters in the game.**

**Responsibilities:**
- Coordinates between movement, combat, health systems
- Manages input routing (player input vs AI input)
- Applies character data (stats, appearance)
- Provides unified update loop for all characters

**Key Methods:**
- `InitializeCharacter()` - Sets up all systems
- `Update()` - Universal update loop (same for player and NPCs)
- `CreateAIForCharacterType()` - Creates appropriate AI for character type

### 2. IInputSource Interface
**The key to the entire system - abstracts input sources.**

```csharp
public interface IInputSource
{
    Vector2 GetMovementInput();  // WASD for player, AI decision for NPCs
    bool GetAttackInput();       // Mouse click for player, AI decision for NPCs
    bool GetJumpInput();         // Future expansion
    bool GetInteractInput();     // Future expansion
}
```

**Implementations:**
- `PlayerInputSource` - Reads from keyboard/mouse
- `GoblinAI_InputSource` - Aggressive AI behavior
- `MammothAI_InputSource` - Peaceful-until-provoked AI

### 3. CharacterData.cs (ScriptableObject)
**Data-driven character definitions - how professionals store character stats.**

**Contains:**
- Health, damage, speed, range values
- AI behavior parameters (aggression, detection range)
- Audio clips and visual materials
- Loot tables and XP rewards

**Usage:**
- Create different data files for each character type
- Assign to UniversalCharacter component
- Tweak stats without touching code

### 4. CharacterMovement Class
**Unified movement system used by all characters.**

**Features:**
- Physics-based movement (Rigidbody support)
- Smooth rotation toward movement direction
- Boundary enforcement
- Same code for player WASD and AI pathfinding

### 5. CharacterCombat Class
**Unified combat system used by all characters.**

**Features:**
- Attack range detection
- Damage dealing
- Cooldown management
- Visual feedback (scaling animation)
- Same code for player attacks and NPC attacks

### 6. HealthSystem.cs
**Universal health management for all characters.**

**Features:**
- HP tracking and damage/healing
- 3D text health displays
- Color-coded health (green/yellow/red)
- Death handling with fade effects
- Event system for other components

## Character System

### Character Types and Their Differences

#### Player Character
```csharp
Character Type: Player
Input Source: PlayerInputSource (keyboard/mouse)
Stats: 100 HP, 15 speed, 25 damage
Special: Gains XP, levels up, gets stronger
```

#### Goblin NPCs
```csharp
Character Type: Goblin  
Input Source: GoblinAI_InputSource
Stats: 30 HP, 8 speed, 10 damage
Behavior: Aggressive, 20-unit detection, pack-oriented
Reward: 15 XP when killed
```

#### Mammoth NPCs
```csharp
Character Type: Mammoth
Input Source: MammothAI_InputSource  
Stats: 150 HP, 4 speed, 40 damage
Behavior: Peaceful until provoked, 5-unit detection when calm
Special: Knockback attacks, ground shake, 50 XP reward
```

### How to Add New Character Types

1. **Create CharacterData ScriptableObject**
2. **Create new AI InputSource** (inherit from IInputSource)
3. **Add character type to enum**
4. **Update UniversalCharacter to handle new type**
5. **Done!** - All systems automatically work

## Migration Path

### From Current System to Unified System

#### Phase 1: Replace Player
1. Remove PlayerController from Player GameObject
2. Add UniversalCharacter component
3. Set Character Type: Player, Input Type: PlayerInput
4. Configure Input Actions

#### Phase 2: Replace Goblins  
1. Remove GoblinAI from goblin prefab
2. Add UniversalCharacter component
3. Set Character Type: Goblin, Input Type: AI
4. Create GoblinData ScriptableObject

#### Phase 3: Add Mammoths
1. Create large cube (3Ã—2Ã—4 scale)
2. Add UniversalCharacter component  
3. Set Character Type: Mammoth, Input Type: AI
4. Create MammothData ScriptableObject

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Input not working"
- Check Input System settings (Edit â†’ Project Settings)
- Verify Input Actions are configured
- Check Console for input debug messages

#### "Character not moving"
- Verify UniversalCharacter component attached
- Check CharacterData is assigned
- Ensure appropriate InputSource is created

#### "Health bars not showing"
- HealthSystem creates 3D text automatically
- Check healthBarHeight setting (should be 3-4)
- Verify Billboard component for camera facing

#### "AI not working"
- Check target assignment (should auto-find player)
- Verify detection ranges in CharacterData
- Check character tags ("Player", "Enemy")

## Extending the System

### Adding New Character Types

#### Example: Adding an Orc
1. **Add to enum**: `CharacterType.Orc`
2. **Create OrcAI_InputSource**:
```csharp
public class OrcAI_InputSource : IInputSource
{
    // Orc-specific AI behavior
    public Vector2 GetMovementInput() { /* orc logic */ }
    public bool GetAttackInput() { /* orc attack logic */ }
}
```
3. **Create OrcData ScriptableObject** with orc stats
4. **Update UniversalCharacter** to handle Orc type
5. **Done!** - All systems automatically work

### Adding New Abilities
1. **Extend IInputSource** with new input methods
2. **Add ability system** to CharacterCombat
3. **All characters** automatically get access to new abilities

### Adding Multiplayer
1. **Create NetworkInputSource** that reads from network
2. **Replace local AI** with network input
3. **Character system remains unchanged**

---

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features
- **Object pooling** for frequently spawned objects
- **LOD system** for distant characters
- **Efficient AI** with configurable update rates
- **Component caching** to avoid GetComponent calls

### Scalability
- **Supports hundreds** of characters simultaneously
- **Data-driven** - easy to create new character types
- **Modular** - can disable unused systems
- **Memory efficient** - shared code and data

## Professional Game Development Patterns

This system demonstrates several industry-standard patterns:

### 1. **Component Pattern** (Unity's core)
- Characters are composed of independent components
- Easy to mix and match behaviors

### 2. **Strategy Pattern** (Input Sources)
- Different input strategies for different character types
- Can swap input sources at runtime

### 3. **Data-Driven Design** (ScriptableObjects)
- Game data separated from code
- Designers can tweak without programming

### 4. **Event System** (Health events)
- Loose coupling between systems
- Easy to add new features that react to events

### 5. **Factory Pattern** (Character creation)
- GameManager creates characters with appropriate configurations
- Centralized creation logic

This is exactly how modern RPGs are built! ðŸš€
